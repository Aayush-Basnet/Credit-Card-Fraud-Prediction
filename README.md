Fraud Detection model based on anonymized credit card transactions

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
[download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download) that will be used to train a transaction classifier.

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

I employed a Random Forest Classifier for predictive modeling. The model exhibited remarkable accuracy, achieving a score of 99.79%.  While this accuracy is promising, it's essential to consider the class imbalance and assess the model's performance using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability in real-world fraud detection scenarios.
